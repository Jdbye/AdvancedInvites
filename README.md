# AdvancedInvites
Allows you to choose between going yourself to the invite you got or drop a portal
to the instance you got invited to.
Doesn't let you drop a portal if it's Friends only or Private(Invite) only.

You can also delete notifications after successful use. (Settings)

# Black/Whitelist system
All blacklisted people can't send you any invites or request at all.
All whitelisted people automatically get their invite requests accepted unless they're on another platform or you're not the instance creator of a private world.
