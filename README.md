# AdvancedInvites
Allows you to choose between going yourself to the invite you got or drop a portal
to the instance you got invited to.
Doesn't let you drop a portal if it's Friends only or Private(Invite) only.

You can also delete notifications after successful use. (Settings)

# Black/Whitelist system
All blacklisted people can't send you any invites or request at all.
All whitelisted people automatically get their invite requests accepted unless they're on another platform or you're not the instance creator of a private world.

Can also blacklist specific worlds and toggle all black/whitelisting systems

# Customization
Can have different Notification Sounds for invites and Invite Requests.
Just name the files either Invite.ogg or InviteRequest.ogg depending on what you want to override.
For just default all in one just change the Default.ogg File

It'll also create a Localization.json file where you can customize the text for each popup
